## Context Menu

The context menu can be found by right-clicking a web page.

__Text encoding__

Available only from the page context menu, this refreshes the active web page. It disables the character encoding conversion that RetroTxt normally applies to text and could be useful if RetroTxt mistakenly scrambles a Unicode text file. Or when you're trying to view text written in a non-English (Latin-1), MS-DOS code page.
