## Documentation

Despite the web being built on text, web browsers are often incapable of accurately displaying texts written during the [BBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system) and early web eras.

This is where RetroTxt comes in! It imports the text into a modern format, injects a font that mimics a chosen retro computer, then applies styling to improve the display and readability. It can also double up as a text viewer for your locally stored, off-line files and even serve as an NFO text viewer.

### Available for installation

Using the [**Chrome store**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/retrotxt/gkjkgilckngllkopkogcaiojfajanahn) and using [**Mozilla Add-ons**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/retrotxt/).
