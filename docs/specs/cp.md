# Code pages and text encoding

Regardless of the source, JavaScript converts all the text it handles into UTF-16.
UTF-16 is based on Unicode and is compatible with UTF-8, and backwards compatible with ISO-8859-1 and US-ASCII. But otherwise, all other loaded text needs to be transcoded to display all characters accurately.
