# Control sequences

Control sequences are strings of characters embedded into the text as cursor, display and presentation functions. ANSI art uses control sequences for both its colourisation and cursor positioning, as do remote terminals used by many Linux and Unix systems such as [_xterm_](http://invisible-island.net/xterm/).
