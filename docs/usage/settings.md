Out of the box, some useful features of RetroTxt are off as most browsers require you to grant permission before RetroTxt can [access the specific browser data](https://docs.retrotxt.com/privacy) it needs. These are in the <em>Settings</em> tab from RetroTxt options ~~or typing `rt settings` in the browser address bar~~.
