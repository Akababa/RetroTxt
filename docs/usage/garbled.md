# Garbled or illegible text?

There could be many causes, but it is generally related to the webserver or browser choosing the incorrect character encoding for the text file.

### Fix on Firefox

Press ++alt++ ++v++ and then ++c++ to select **Repair Text Encoding** in the browser.

---

### All other browsers

Without using a 3rd-party Extension, **Chrome**, **Brave**, and **Edge** cannot switch the character encoding.

You could manually switch the transcoding RetroTxt applies by right-clicking on the page and selecting **Transcode text** from the [RetroTxt context menu](../menus).
