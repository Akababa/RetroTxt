# Garbled text?

There could be many causes of this, but it is generally related to the web server or browser choosing the incorrect character encoding for the text file.

### Fix on Firefox

In the browser, press ++alt++ ++v++ and then ++c++ to select **Repair Text Encoding**.

---

### All other browsers

Without using a 3rd-party Extension, **Chrome**, **Brave**, and **Edge** cannot switch the character encoding.

You could also manually switch the transcoding RetroTxt applies by right-clicking on the page and select **Transcode text** from the RetroTxt context menu.
