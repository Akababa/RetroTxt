# Garbled or illegible text?

There could be many causes, but it is generally related to the web server or browser choosing the incorrect character encoding for the text file.

### Fix on Firefox

To select **Repair Text Encoding** in the browser.

++alt++ ++v++ then ++c++

### Chrome and other browsers

Without a 3rd-party Extension, **Chrome** and **Edge** cannot switch the character encoding. Unfortunately these extensions seem to be incompatible with RetroTxt.

[You can attempt to manually switch the transcoding of the tab](../char).
