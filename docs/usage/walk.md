You can test the RetroTxt install by clicking on one of the many sample artworks found in the _Samples_ tab from RetroTxt options or typing `rt samples` in the browser address bar.

Once configured, RetroTxt will run on any text or ANSI art file observed in a permitted browser tab and mark the toolbar icon with a check.

Elsewhere there are thousands of text files hosted at [textfiles.com](http://textfiles.com/directory.html) or the [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/catalog) plain-text books.
Turn on the <em>Use RetroTxt as a local text file viewer</em> setting.
Then download one of the fantastic text art packs found at [16 colors](https://16colo.rs) and use the `file:///` protocol to browse and view the text art files saved to your computer.
