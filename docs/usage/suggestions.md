You can change these sites in the settings of RetroTxt, under the <strong>Run RetroTxt on files hosted on these domains</strong> within Feature.<br>
Or type `txt settings` in the browser address bar.

The only permanent domain is [retrotxt.com](https://retrotxt.com), which is used as a fallback to confirm the Extension installation. This domain also hosts the Sample artworks you can access by typing `txt samples` in an address bar.

The samples are also browsable using: [retrotxt.com/e](https://retrotxt.com/e)
