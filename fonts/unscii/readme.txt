Unscii is a set of bitmapped Unicode fonts based on classic system fonts. Unscii attempts to support character cell art well while also being suitable for terminal and programming use.

The two main variants are unscii-8 (8x8) and unscii-16 (8x16). There are also several alternative styles for unscii-8, as well as a 8x16 "full" variant that incorporates missing Unicode glyphs from Fixedsys Excelsior and GNU Unifont. "unscii-16-full" falls under GPL because of how Unifont is licensed; the other variants are in the Public Domain.

Unscii was created by Viznut.
